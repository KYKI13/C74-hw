                <p class="text-muted">Quaint little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss
                    the
                    entrance to the cafe. So be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while
                    you
                    are on the main road. The restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is
                    delicious,
                    the servings are quite large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy
                    crowd of aspiring celebrities on show days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments.
                    On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep & happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest",
                    which you must attend if possible.</p>

                <p class="text-muted">It is a wonderful place. Must visit this place. Hiring a tour guide will be better
                    to understand the stories of such a historical place. It is a beautifully maintained small complex
                    with yellow painted walls. It is a historical site and famous among tourists. It contains a number
                    of different devices that were used to measure time in different eras in the Indian history. It has
                    a nominal ticket price of ₹15 for Indians but about ₹225-250 for foreigners. Nice place to visit. We
                    had an incredible experience visiting this observatory and seeing the accuracy of the astronomical
                    instruments built around 300 years ago.</p>
